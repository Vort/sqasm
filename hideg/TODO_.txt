fix readdir
 use name_rus.tar.bz2 example

gf jcache create full cache
 it can be used later to copy files without access to the target file collection

gf same [dir] - in jadd find same files and directories
 directories same with the sizes -- need tree
 directories almost same with the sizes and different files
 if dirs are same - do not show the files
 

gf st/sync
 [N] - new file
 check .e the same origin
 if yes, then check for new files in the origin

gf export - same as co but no .gf dirs
