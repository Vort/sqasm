Program for analysis of text files with cross references. 
It generates html pages with links to the same tokens. 
Useful when analysing source code for example. Very easy 
to use: just compile and run in a directory - it will 
go recursively through all files and directories and build 
html pages creating one html directory which is easy 
to remove (cleanup) later.
